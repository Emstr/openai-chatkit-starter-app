His credentials include CFP®, CLU®, ChFC®, RICP®, CLF®, and an M.S. in Family Financial Planning.<br />He recently earned his Ph.D. in Personal Financial Planning at Kansas State University while also imparting his knowledge on financial planning to undergraduate students as an Adjunct Professor at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln and graduate students at Columbia University. His research, primarily centered on behavioral finance, explores the intersection of financial, physical, and psychological well-being, and how consumer’s choices surrounding their finances impact them. <br />Bennetts' scholarly contributions span a diverse range of topics, including the application of AI in financial planning, the influence of behavior on investment allocations during volatile markets, and the positive impact of bequest intentions on retirement satisfaction.<br />His influential work on the necessity of financial planning/counseling in PTSD treatment for Veterans has been recognized and utilized by the U.S. Congress as well as White House staff. During a legislative fellowship he was awarded in 2023, this advocacy led to his involvement in Congressional hearings and assisting in the drafting of legislation. These efforts resulted in the VA creating FINVET which is a no cost, robust informational portal that also allows veterans and caregivers the ability to meet with an Accredited Financial Counselor (AFC®). <br />His commitment to his field and his passion for advocacy underscores his dedication to the financial well-being of individuals and communities.<br /><p>",

This keynote by Milo Wilkinson fuses cutting-edge neuroscience with behavioural futurism to reveal how the primal brain drives modern decisions—and how that will shape the way we live, lead, and connect in the decade ahead.\r\n<p>\r\nLed by Behavioural Scientist Milo Wilkinson—whose work spans elite sports, high-security interrogations, and Fortune 100 boardrooms—this keynote pulls back the curtain on your subconscious mind, the 90% of cognition you never see, yet which shapes every decision you make. You’ll take part in a real-world psychological experiment, unlocking your mental agility and understanding the neuroscience behind resilience.\r\n<p>\r\nBut this isn’t just a deep dive into you. It’s also a wake-up call about us—where society is going and why. From virtual sneakers and brain-computer interfaces to slow content and synthetic relationships, Milo dissects the case studies and cultural shifts that matter, revealing what’s really happening beneath the surface of consumer behaviour, leadership psychology, and digital life.\r\n<p>\r\nExpect to walk away with:<br>\r\n• A blueprint of your brain’s decision-making systems—and how to train them<br>\r\n• The psychological drivers behind future human behaviour<br>\r\n• A new understanding of resilience, agility, and leadership in a new age<br>\r\n• Clear, science-backed insights to help you lead, create, and adapt for what’s next<br><p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis isn’t a keynote.

Susie had all the other shareholders and advisers at Goldsborough on board with the need for these changes and developed a fee calculator which: reflected the ‘Goldsborough Way’, closely aligning the value the clients received with the fees they paid.  The following year, the project was to review each ongoing service client’s pricing and transitioned to the new arrangement.  <br />She enjoys the challenges, opportunities and team spirit that working at Goldsborough has offered her for many years.<br /><p>",

Scott felt it was important to base his firm around truly understanding clients' needs and charging on a transparent fee-for-advice policy. <br />Today, Scott is sitting back as a mentor for Fitzpatrick's, looking on towards his next projects, The Great Advisory Frameworks, (The GAF), and Significant Advice Network, (SAN).<br />The GAF is his online course giving advisors the business frameworks they need to build a great advisory business. Getting clarity around your value, capability and purpose is crucial to success. But more than that, The GAF helps participants to appreciate what makes a great life for them, and to love the work they do. <br />The Significant Advice Network coaching & mentoring program designed for experienced accounting, legal and financial Advisers who are looking for career extension and would like, in their next chapter of work, to sit on the family board. The Program provides Advisers with the tools, skills and capabilities to broaden the conversation with Individual's and Families and to create a plan to deliver the client’s vision with the highest degree of probability and the lowest amount of risk.<br />Future clients want their SAN Adviser to know how to think about all their problems, construct a lifetime plan and drive them, the family and the business from ‘Chaos to Greatness’.<br /><p>",

Join us for a high-octane journey through the past, present, and future of advice, where we will assess the speed of innovation required to succeed into the future. \r\n<br>\r\nWe open with a shock factor: a visceral look at the speed of change, the fear of overload, and the risk of complacency. Through interactive statistics and audience insights, we assess where we are—and where we must go.\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey continues through the current landscape of 2025, where advice is still largely manual, expensive, and exclusive. We explore the problems of scale, privacy, and brand dilution, and confront the confusion around AI—which tools to trust, and how to use them without losing the human touch.<p>\r\n<b>Learning Outcomes</b><br>\r\nAttendees will learn about the following:<br>\r\n- Understand your client data and how it is organised. <br>\r\n- What new tools are available to harness your client data efficiently and timely to service your client's better.

Seventeen years ago, he arrived in Brisbane with just a suitcase and a dream of building a better future.<br /><br />Pedro earned a Bachelor of International Business with a Finance major from Griffith University and a postgraduate degree in Accounting from Queensland University of Technology. He also holds a Diploma in Financial Planning and the Certified Financial Planner (CFP®) designation from the Financial Advice Association Australia (FAAA).<br /><br />His career began with an internship at the University of Queensland, followed by a role as a credit analyst at Grant Thornton. Realizing accounting wasn’t his passion, he pivoted to financial planning—working as a strategist, paraplanner, and then advisor at UniSuper.<br /><br />In 2020, Pedro launched his own practice, initially as Bell Partners. By July 2023, he founded Marin Wealth, where his entrepreneurial vision thrives. Today, Marin Wealth supports almost 200 families across Australia, growing by 3–4 new families each month.

Let’s rethink the advice process by focusing on the client journey, transforming compliance from a requirement into a catalyst for delivering high quality and impactful advice outcomes. In this workshop, efficiency and compliance go head-to-head as we dive into practical ways advice businesses leverage smart ideas, real-world examples, and a focus on what’s possible when everything works together.<p>\r\n<b>Learning Outcomes</b><br>\r\nAttendees will learn about the following:<br>\r\n- To use the Triple Win framework to deliver early value, reduce client effort, and enhance compliance outcomes.<br>\r\n- Apply strategy meetings and modelling tools to clarify goals without triggering formal advice obligations<br>\r\n- Identify compliance pitfalls and implement controls to manage legal, operational, and reputational risks.<br>\r\n- Segment advice delivery to streamline processes, improve affordability, and support sustainable business practices.\r\n\r\n",

As CFO of Virgin Money, he contributed to the launch of products in general insurance, life insurance, mortgages, and superannuation. He was also involved in establishing the Digital Currency Commerce Association, which later became Blockchain Australia, and worked with industry and government to support changes to GST laws on digital currencies. This included contributing to discussions with the Senate Economics Committee in the United States on how collaboration between government and industry can deliver better outcomes.<br />The Global Financial Crisis sparked Angus’s interest in financial planning and highlighted the need for higher standards of advice. This led him to found Adviser Ratings, following his earlier work helping to build One Big Switch, a consumer platform for energy, insurance, and banking. Today, the AR Group has grown into a data-focused business with services including Adviser Ratings, ARdata, Beddoes Institute, ProductRex, and the SMA Standard. Its goal is to build a trusted, permissioned data-sharing platform that helps organisations navigate wealth management through better information and gives advisers the tools to deliver better results for clients.<br />Angus serves on the Board of the UNSW AI Institute, holds a Master’s in Accounting, a Graduate Diploma in Applied Finance and Investment, and is a Certified Practicing Accountant.<br /><p>",

In these moments, financial advisers don’t just provide advice—they provide stability. However, this responsibility comes with ethical risks: Are clients making informed choices? Are they too stressed to fully understand consequences? Is the adviser’s own bias shaping their recommendations? This powerful and interactive session combines behavioural science, ethical frameworks, and real-world financial scenarios to help advisers navigate life’s toughest client conversations. Attendees will leave with practical tools, to ensure they provide ethically sound, client-first advice under pressure while maintaining professional boundaries.<p>\r\n<b>Learning Outcomes</b>\r\nAttendees will learn about the following:<br>\r\n- Gain insights into how stress and life transitions affect financial decision-making,<br>\r\n- Identify cognitive biases that distort financial judgment (for both clients and advisers),<br>\r\n- Learn to balance empathy with professionalism - ensuring ethical, clear-headed advice.<br>\r\n- Recognise ethical risks in crisis-driven decisions and leave with a structured approach to providing sound financial advice under high-stress conditions\r\n",

Tracy had a successful career, was intelligent and financially independent, but she didn’t have a financial adviser or a financial plan for her future. And that, she believes, made all the difference.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this session, Tracy shares her very public story of loss and recovery, but more importantly, she highlights how her financial adviser became the key to rebuilding her finances, her confidence, and her future. She explores the psychological tactics used by scammers, the critical moments when people are most financially vulnerable, and the powerful role advisers can play - not just in growing wealth but in protecting it.\r\n <p>\r\nAdvisers be armed with insights and practical tips into how you can use structured processes, emotional intelligence, and accessible technology to protect your clients. From identifying behavioural red flags to providing cyber-savvy tools and emotional support, Tracy demonstrates how you can become one of your clients’ most valuable lines of defence, helping your clients feel less vulnerable to cyber and fraud attacks.\r\n <p>\r\nTracy’s message is clear: when it comes to financial resilience, advisers are not optional - they’re essential.<p>\r\n<b>Learning Outcomes</b><br> \r\nAttendees will learn about the following:<br>\r\n- Identify behavioural red flags and psychological tactics scammers use to exploit client vulnerability and urgency.<br>\r\n- Apply structured advice processes and emotional intelligence to rebuild client trust, confidence, and financial resilience.<br>\r\n- Use accessible technology and scam prevention tools to educate clients and reduce exposure to cyber fraud.<br>\r\n- Support clients in restoring financial agency through literacy, planning, and proactive fraud protection strategies\r\n",

This reflects the economic reality of the industry but also underscores a growing challenge: the advice gap. With 16.4 million Australians seeking advice and only 15,500 advisers available, driving scale is essential.\r\nWhile platforms have taken us far, transformative productivity gains require more than platform evolution. Fragmented data and limited integration across the advice process—especially in areas like client engagement, strategic implementation, and workflow management—continue to hinder efficiency.<p> \r\nIn recent years, HUB24 has made several strategic acquisitions—including Agility Applications, Class, and myprosperity—to end fragmentation across the advice process. This session will showcase how HUB24 is delivering measurable improvements, empowering advisers to scale their impact, deepen client relationships, and run more profitable businesses.<p>\r\n<b>Learning Outcomes</b><br>\r\nAttendees will learn about the following:<br>\r\n- Identify industry challenges driving the advice gap and the need for scalable, tailored advice solutions.<br> \r\n- Evaluate HUB24’s integrated technology stack for improving adviser productivity and client engagement.<br> \r\n- Understand how platform evolution and AI enhance strategic implementation across the advice process.<br>\r\n- Apply practical insights from adviser experiences to optimise workflow and business profitability.\r\n\r\n",

With the Transfer Balance Cap rising to $2 million from 1 July 2025 and corresponding shifts in Total Super Balance thresholds, financial planners face a new wave of complexity—and opportunity. This session dives deep into the mechanics of superannuation caps and balances, focusing on how they impact clients in the decumulation phase. We’ll explore how market volatility, mortality events, and regulatory thresholds interact to affect retirement income streams, estate planning, and contribution strategies.<br>\r\nBut this isn’t just about numbers. We know that clients in retirement respond emotionally to market movements, often in ways that defy logic. Their ability to sleep at night isn’t always tied to their wealth. That’s why we’ll also examine behavioural responses and how to use layered income strategies—including account-based pensions, annuities, and reserve management—to support a client’s hierarchy of spending while mitigating longevity, sequencing, and legislative risks.<p>\r\nKey takeaways:<br>\r\n• Understand the 2025–26 TSB and TBC changes and how they affect contribution eligibility and retirement phase transfers.<br>\r\n• Learn how to model the impact of market movements and death on super caps and balances<br>\r\n• Discover decumulation strategies that align with both financial and emotional client needs.<br>\r\n• Gain insights into combining income streams to create resilient, tax-effective retirement portfolios.<br><p>\r\n<b>Learning Outcomes</b>\r\nAttendees will learn about the following:<br>\r\n- Interpret and apply the 2025–26 Transfer Balance Cap (TBC) and Total Super Balance (TSB) changes<br>\r\n- Model the impact of market movements, death, and portfolio growth on superannuation caps<br>\r\n- Evaluate and implement layered retirement income strategies\r\nDesign decumulation strategies that balance technical optimisation with emotional client needs<br>\r\n- Apply strategic thinking to manage cap limits proactively<br>\r\n- Communicate technical strategies effectively to diverse client scenarios<br>\r\n",

Whether it is a foreign resident coming to Australia, or an Australian resident moving overseas, it is important that advisers are aware of the taxation implications to then guide their clients on the areas for them to consider and enable any proactive action or strategies to be undertaken before moving.  In this session, Cooper Partners’ resident specialists Jemma Sanderson and Rachel Pritchard will outline the following from a taxation and strategy planning perspective:<p>\r\n- When an Australian resident is departing Australia and has Australian assets<br>\r\n- When a non-resident is planning to move to Australia or is already onshore and might be looking to sell foreign assets<br>\r\n- When an Australian resident is looking at the transfer of foreign pension assets that are not “foreign superannuation fund” assets<br>\r\n-When an Australian resident is looking at the transfer of foreign pension assets that are “foreign superannuation fund” assets<br>\r\n<p>\r\nThis area is important to be proactive and in front of clients early to manage any taxation risk and implement any strategies for their best financial outcome.<p>\r\n<b>Learning Outcomes</b><br>\r\nAttendees will learn about the following:<br>\r\n- Interpret residency tests and their impact on capital gains tax and income tax obligations for clients relocating to or from Australia.<br>\r\n- Evaluate the tax treatment of foreign pension assets, including the distinction between foreign superannuation funds and other pension structures.<br>\r\n- Assess the implications of cross-border ownership of trusts and companies, including controlled foreign company (CFC) rules and double tax agreement considerations.<br>\r\n- Recognise the scope and limitations of financial advisers in international tax matters, and identify when to refer clients to specialist tax professionals.<br>\r\n",

This session explores the transformative journey of a business-owner client referred in 2021, who began with just $200k in investable assets, a tangled and inefficient business structure, a debt-laden SMSF, with the dream of an eight-year runway to retirement.\r\nFast forward four years, and through a meticulously coordinated advice strategy—spanning business restructuring, SMSF optimization, debt elimination, investment strategy and diversification, risk protection, and estate planning—the client is now debt-free with nearly $4 million in investable assets and ready to retire at 58.\r\nThis case study showcases how collaborative advice across professionals—financial advisers, accountants, and legal experts—can unlock cascading financial outcomes, much like a well-orchestrated tower of prosperity flowing seamlessly across entities. It’s a testament to the power of strategic alignment, timing, and execution in delivering extraordinary results for complex clients.<p>\r\n<b>Learning Outcomes</b><br>\r\nAttendees will learn about the following:<br>\r\n- Identify structural inefficiencies in complex client entities impacting tax, asset protection, and retirement outcomes.<br>\r\n- Coordinate financial, legal, and accounting advice to deliver integrated strategies for business-owner clients.<br> \r\n- Apply tax planning tools like Division 7A and bucket companies to optimise cash flow and reduce liabilities.<br>\r\n- Embed insurance and estate planning into succession strategies to protect wealth and ensure continuity.\r\n",

            "PresentationBio": "Mel Jones was a superstar on the field and is now one of the most in demand media hosts off it.<br />Born in the UK, Mel at just 3 months old and her Australian mum arrived back in Melbourne with her West Indian father staying in the UK.<br />Playing alongside modern cricketing greats such as Karen Rolton and Belinda Clark and against Charlotte Edwards and Jhulan Goswami, Jones played in a dominant era of Australian cricket internationally. Jones was a middle-order batter and first tasted major success as a part of Australia’s win in the 1997 Women’s Cricket World Cup against New Zealand at Eden Gardens, Kolkata in front of 70,000.<br />On her test match debut Jones hit 131 on Australia’s Ashes tour of England, and was also a part of the victorious home Women’s Ashes series win of 2003. Closing out her professional playing career in dramatic fashion, Jones was again a part of Australia’s 2005 Women’s Cricket World Cup final title win in South Africa. Jones also had a reputation as one of the world’s finest fielders.<br />During her playing days, Mel used her teaching degree to juggle her career on the field by working in cricket development in not only Australia but also South Africa and England. After retiring from her playing career, Jones has focused on the next chapter of her professional career that has aimed to support, develop and expand opportunities and careers for women in sport both on and off the cricket field.<br />In 2015 after becoming one of the four first-ever female commentators to be included in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world’s most attended and watched cricket league, she moved full time into sports commentary in 2018. Her inclusion into the men’s and women’s Big Bash broadcast lead to her becoming the first female cricket lead in the T20 format in Australia. This was then followed by the same accolade in the Pakistan Super League in 2017.<br />In 2018, Mel was announced as part of Fox Sport’s Cricket team, where she is a now part of the coverage alongside some of the biggest names in the game. And has lead calls including men’s and women’s world cups and the enthralling 2023 men’s and women’s Ashes series for Sky Sport.<br />As a former talent manager of some of Australia’s biggest sporting stars, Mel has also worked and volunteered for various roles across women in sport task forces as well as joining the board of Bowls Australia. In January of 2019, Jones was presented with one of Australia’s highest honours; the Medal of the Order of Australia for services towards cricket and the community. Later that year in November, Jones took on a new role as a Director on the board of Cricket Australia.<br />Mel is a regular when it comes to getting involved in charity work and initiatives surrounding equality. Mel is currently an ambassador for Victoria University and Red Dust Role Models.<br /><p><br /><b><u><a href=\"https://youtu.be/oxTOt_wDjfg\" target=\"_blank\">Watch Mel's video</a></u></b>",

            "PresentationBio": "Born in Bellingen, NSW in 1971, Adam Gilchrist is one of Australia’s most admired and respected personalities. Described by Steve Waugh as a “once in a generation cricketer” and one of the best teammates he ever had, Adam is a proven leader and role model both on and off the field. A father of four and devoted family man, he is known for his integrity, passion, and approachable nature. <br />Adam began playing cricket at age 7 in country NSW and rose rapidly through the ranks, representing NSW and Australia at Under-19 level before making his first-class debut at the SCG in 1992. He joined the Australian One Day team in 1997, and two years later became the Test wicketkeeper, holding the position for 96 consecutive matches until his retirement in 2008. As a key member of one of Australia’s greatest cricket teams, Adam captained the national side, reached No.1 in the ICC batting rankings, and retired with a then world record for wicketkeeping dismissals. In 2010, he was named in ESPN CricInfo’s Greatest Ever World XI and voted the greatest wicketkeeper-batsman of all time. <br />Beyond cricket, Adam has been a high-profile ambassador for numerous Australian corporations, government bodies and charities. He is currently a lead commentator on Fox Sports and remains a sought-after media personality across television, radio, social media and print. <br />Adam’s public service includes his 2008 appointment as Chairperson of the Australia Day Council, overseeing national celebrations and awards. In 2014, he became Australia’s first Education Ambassador to India, participating in key government and education forums. <br />A passionate philanthropist, Adam is patron of Ronald McDonald House Western Australia, where he has personally supported families of seriously ill children and led a successful $20 million fundraising campaign to expand the facility. He also serves as a World Vision ambassador, contributing to projects across India and the subcontinent. <br />Adam is a symbol of excellence, humility, and service—values deeply cherished by Australians and inspiring to audiences worldwide. <br /><br /><b><u><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4WmfkfCjo5c\" target=\"_blank\">Watch Adam's video</a></u></b>",

Catherine delivers keynotes that challenge audiences to see the unseen, rethink the status quo and take action. A former bank executive, she brings a mix of expertise, experience and pragmatism to unmask and disrupt financial abuse. Her talks are thought-provoking, practical and deeply human, leaving audiences with a clearer understanding of the hidden risks and a roadmap for real change.  Nearly 30 years ago, Catherine met a woman whose tragic story shaped her career.  Since then, she’s led industry-wide reforms, advised governments on financial abuse policy and pioneered the financial safety by design framework – helping leading brands protect customers, manage risk and strengthen trust.  Her ground-breaking Designed to Disrupt™ reports and #respectandprotect campaign have led to world-first action from more than 45 businesses across 10 sectors, ensuring more than 20 million customers are better protected.  Catherine is Adjunct Associate Professor, UNSW School of Social Sciences, and holds advisory roles with the Commonwealth and NSW governments and the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation. She’s co-founder of the One Generation business alliance against domestic and family violence, launched with former Australian of the Year Rosie Batty AO in 2024.

        "Bio": "Born in Bellingen, NSW in 1971, Adam Gilchrist is one of Australia’s most admired and respected personalities. Described by Steve Waugh as a “once in a generation cricketer” and one of the best teammates he ever had, Adam is a proven leader and role model both on and off the field. A father of four and devoted family man, he is known for his integrity, passion, and approachable nature. <br/>Adam began playing cricket at age 7 in country NSW and rose rapidly through the ranks, representing NSW and Australia at Under-19 level before making his first-class debut at the SCG in 1992. He joined the Australian One Day team in 1997, and two years later became the Test wicketkeeper, holding the position for 96 consecutive matches until his retirement in 2008. As a key member of one of Australia’s greatest cricket teams, Adam captained the national side, reached No.1 in the ICC batting rankings, and retired with a then world record for wicketkeeping dismissals. In 2010, he was named in ESPN CricInfo’s Greatest Ever World XI and voted the greatest wicketkeeper-batsman of all time. <br/>Beyond cricket, Adam has been a high-profile ambassador for numerous Australian corporations, government bodies and charities. He is currently a lead commentator on Fox Sports and remains a sought-after media personality across television, radio, social media and print. <br/>Adam’s public service includes his 2008 appointment as Chairperson of the Australia Day Council, overseeing national celebrations and awards. In 2014, he became Australia’s first Education Ambassador to India, participating in key government and education forums. <br/>A passionate philanthropist, Adam is patron of Ronald McDonald House Western Australia, where he has personally supported families of seriously ill children and led a successful $20 million fundraising campaign to expand the facility. He also serves as a World Vision ambassador, contributing to projects across India and the subcontinent. <br/>Adam is a symbol of excellence, humility, and service—values deeply cherished by Australians and inspiring to audiences worldwide. <br/><br/><b><u><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4WmfkfCjo5c\" target=\"_blank\">Watch Adam's video</a></u></b>",

        "Bio": "Mel Jones was a superstar on the field and is now one of the most in demand media hosts off it.<br/>Born in the UK, Mel at just 3 months old and her Australian mum arrived back in Melbourne with her West Indian father staying in the UK.<br/>Playing alongside modern cricketing greats such as Karen Rolton and Belinda Clark and against Charlotte Edwards and Jhulan Goswami, Jones played in a dominant era of Australian cricket internationally. Jones was a middle-order batter and first tasted major success as a part of Australia’s win in the 1997 Women’s Cricket World Cup against New Zealand at Eden Gardens, Kolkata in front of 70,000.<br/>On her test match debut Jones hit 131 on Australia’s Ashes tour of England, and was also a part of the victorious home Women’s Ashes series win of 2003. Closing out her professional playing career in dramatic fashion, Jones was again a part of Australia’s 2005 Women’s Cricket World Cup final title win in South Africa. Jones also had a reputation as one of the world’s finest fielders.<br/>During her playing days, Mel used her teaching degree to juggle her career on the field by working in cricket development in not only Australia but also South Africa and England. After retiring from her playing career, Jones has focused on the next chapter of her professional career that has aimed to support, develop and expand opportunities and careers for women in sport both on and off the cricket field.<br/>In 2015 after becoming one of the four first-ever female commentators to be included in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world’s most attended and watched cricket league, she moved full time into sports commentary in 2018. Her inclusion into the men’s and women’s Big Bash broadcast lead to her becoming the first female cricket lead in the T20 format in Australia. This was then followed by the same accolade in the Pakistan Super League in 2017.<br/>In 2018, Mel was announced as part of Fox Sport’s Cricket team, where she is a now part of the coverage alongside some of the biggest names in the game. And has lead calls including men’s and women’s world cups and the enthralling 2023 men’s and women’s Ashes series for Sky Sport.<br/>As a former talent manager of some of Australia’s biggest sporting stars, Mel has also worked and volunteered for various roles across women in sport task forces as well as joining the board of Bowls Australia. In January of 2019, Jones was presented with one of Australia’s highest honours; the Medal of the Order of Australia for services towards cricket and the community. Later that year in November, Jones took on a new role as a Director on the board of Cricket Australia.<br/>Mel is a regular when it comes to getting involved in charity work and initiatives surrounding equality. Mel is currently an ambassador for Victoria University and Red Dust Role Models.<br/><p><br/><b><u><a href=\"https://youtu.be/oxTOt_wDjfg\" target=\"_blank\">Watch Mel's video</a></u></b>",
